# Challenge 1 - Refactoring for semantics and accessability

## Purpose

The purpose of this the challenge was to test our skill and knowledge of semantics.

## What I learned

Semantics are an important part of html pages. Divs are used to group elements together but do not do much to communicate what the purpose of each section of a page is for. Semantics are used on the imporant elements of the pages to communicate. This is particularly important with accessabilty screen readers. E.g. when a visually impared user combs the page with a verbal screen reader the semantic elements call out where are user's cursor is located.

## My experience with this challenge

This challenge wasn't very difficult for me. I was able to apply what I already knew about html and css. On my first pass I missed an id that was affecting functionality of the nav links. On my second pass I fixed the link but also applied what I learned in last nights lesson about `position` to make the header sticky. I also added a link to the h1 in the header to allow the user to navigate back to the top of the page.

## Considerations

I look forward to seeing actual scroll behavior be applied to a page like this. I.e. when I click a link in the nav bar it would be neat to see the page actually scroll to that section.

I would like to apply what I learned about media queries to a page. I will try to do it to this page if I can get some more time to practice. But I'm sure we will have the function appear in future challenges.
